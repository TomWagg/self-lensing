# Useful Resources

## Other research
The main one that we'll use for the modelling is [Masuda & Hotokezaka 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10856.pdf). This contains all of the equations for the self-lensing model.

Here's a list of papers that relate to the project that you might be interested in.
