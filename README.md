  <h1>Searching for Optical Lensing Signals of Elusive Black Holes</h1>
  <div align="left">
  <p>
   It's estimated that there are over 100 million stellar-mass black holes in the Milky Way and yet to date we have still only found a handful. Some black holes have been discovered using gravitational waves (LIGO!) in distant galaxies, but for the Milky Way the majority have been discovered using X-ray binary techniques. The difficulty with finding black holes is that they emit no light, so direct imaging of black holes is extremely difficult.

       Thankfully, black holes often are formed in binaries with ordinary stars. Therefore, we can *infer* the existence of a black hole by measuring the light from the companion star. In particular, we focus on the technique of optical gravitational self-lensing. This phenomenon occurs when the black hole passes in front of the companion star along our line of sight and leads to a dramatic magnification of light due to the effect of gravitational lensing. This method allows us to uncover invisible black holes lurking in binary systems.

       This project will leverage data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to discover possible self-lensing black hole binaries. Combining this data with currently known catalogues of binary stars, students will further examine these light curves to find the possible signals of self-lensing.

       Students will also learn how to model the signal of the self-lensing binary in Python. The aim is to create an interactive fitting tool for identifying the signals within TESS photometry. This tool can then be used to search the TESS data and potentially discover the first self-lensing black hole binary.
